Project Understanding
Your platform is an AI-Powered Therapeutic Education Platform with:

React frontend with bilingual support (Arabic/English)
Python FastAPI AI service with 10 ML engines
Existing autism screening model trained on real dataset
Multiple user roles (parent, therapist, school_admin, system_admin)
Current AI analysis modals that only accept text input

Plan: Enhanced Admin Training Dashboard

1. Real-Time Audio Analysis Enhancement
Add Web Audio API integration to SpeechAnalysisModal for live microphone recording
Implement audio recording controls (start, stop, pause, visualize waveform)
Add audio file upload capability for pre-recorded samples
Create audio preprocessing service to convert recordings to format compatible with ML engines
Send recorded audio to backend speech engine for real analysis
Update speech engine to process actual audio files using librosa
Display real-time pronunciation feedback during recording

2. Real-Time Video Analysis Enhancement

Add WebRTC integration to BehaviorAnalysisModal and EmotionDetectionModal for live camera access
Implement video recording controls with live preview
Add video file upload with format validation (MP4, WebM, AVI)
Create frame extraction service for video processing
Send video frames to behavior and emotion engines for real-time analysis
Update emotion engine to use actual facial recognition models
Update behavior engine to analyze movement patterns from video
Display real-time analysis feedback overlay on video preview

3. AI Model Training Admin Dashboard

Create new AIModelTrainingPage component accessible only to system_admin role
Add navigation menu item for "AI Model Training" in admin sidebar
Build dataset management interface to view available datasets in ai-service/datas folder
Create training configuration panel with hyperparameter controls
Implement model selection dropdown (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
Add training/testing split ratio selector
Build feature selection interface for choosing input columns
Create target variable selector for classification/regression tasks

4. Training Progress Monitoring

Implement WebSocket connection between frontend and AI service for real-time updates

Display live training metrics (accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score)
Build real-time chart visualization for training vs validation performance
Show confusion matrix after training completion
Display feature importance rankings
Add training time estimation and elapsed time counter
Implement training cancellation capability

5. Model Testing and Evaluation Interface

Create model comparison table showing all trained models
Display evaluation metrics for each model version
Add test data upload for model validation
Build prediction testing panel for single sample predictions
Show cross-validation scores with statistical analysis
Implement ROC curve and precision-recall curve visualization
Create model versioning system with save/load/delete options
Add model deployment toggle to activate best performing model
